# Malware-Visualization
Repository for malware visualization project for DFIR (and possible thesis).

# Questions
1. What's the difference between PE and ELF file formats?
2. Exactly what steps do the authors take from start to end for visualizing PE files?
    - What information do they parse from the header?
    - What sections are they grabbbing?
    - What characteristics of each section are they calculating?
3. How can I apply their approach to ELF files?

# Thoughts
* I'd like to translate their approach to the ELF file format. Ideally, I want to translate it across different file formats, not just ELF, but I need to start somewhere. Also, there might be better ways of parsing out an ELF file than how the authors parse out PE files, but starting with translating what their doing gives me a starting point.
