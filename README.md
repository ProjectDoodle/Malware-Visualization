# Malware-Visualization
Repository for malware visualization project for DFIR (and possible thesis).

# Questions
1. What's the difference between PE and ELF file formats?
2. Exactly what steps do the authors take from start to end for visualizing PE files?
    - What information do they parse from the header?
    - What sections are they grabbbing?
    - What characteristics of each section are they calculating?
3. How can I apply their approach to ELF files?

# Approach
1. Take in any amount of files as input and return only those that are ELF files (based on signature)
2. Parse out the ELF file and split it into it's 3 components: header, segments, sections. Store these into (nested) dictionaries
3. Calculate byte values, entropy, and size as characterstics (for now)

# Thoughts
* I'd like to translate their approach to the ELF file format. Ideally, I want to translate it across different file formats, not just ELF, but I need to start somewhere. Also, there might be better ways of parsing out an ELF file than how the authors parse out PE files, but starting with translating what their doing gives me a starting point.

# Author's Methodology
- Byte values can directly reflect the nature of malware, but are subject to change, so they use entropy and size of sections as ways to represent more stable aspect of malware
- In order to enhance the robustness of the moethod when dealing with complex datasets, they decided to find local features from the code and data sections of malware
- They focused only on the sequences of consecutive byte values that can be converted to strings, because these byte sequences usually represent key information such as string constants, API calls, and DLLs (which could be inherited into variants)
- For feature extraction, which came after the image was created, they focused on grabbing global features from the RGB color image and extracted local features (byte sequences) from the malware, then merged them
- They used GLCM to extract texture features
- They used color moment to describe color features
- They used different ML algorithms for classification
